This folder contains the original etree implementation found in Python 2.7.x 
source code. It is here only to avoid a direct requirement on Python 2.7 and 
allow to execute the code on older python versions. 

This library is unused at the moment, and has been replaced by the use of lxml.
It will be removed from the sources in the future.

See Python sources for more information on licenses and copyrights.
